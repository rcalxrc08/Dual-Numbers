The dualnumber MATLAB class implements dual numbers and is designed to compute exact first derivatives. 
 This functions implemented in this class include basic mathematical functions.

Every effort has been made to ensure that this implementation is mathematically correct and free from bugs, but this cannot be guaranteed.  
If you find an error or bug please let me know.

The @dualnumber directory should be located in your MATLAB path

This class is derived from dualnumber.tgz which was downloaded from http://adl.stanford.edu/hyperdual/
